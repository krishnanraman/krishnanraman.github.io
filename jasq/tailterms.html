 engine users ( i.e. every single one of us ) go to a search engine ( 
google.com, bing.com, yandex.com etc. ) and search for a term.<br>Say 
you search for "red shoes". You then get shown a bunch of red shoe ads. 
You hopefully click on the ad, that takes you to a "landing page" where 
these shoes are sold. You maybe purchase a shoe - you click on the shoe 
and put it in the shopping cart and enter your credit card number &amp; 
boom - you have converted! You saw the ad - an IMPRESSION, following 
which you gave the ad publisher a CLICK then a CONVERSION.&nbsp;<br><br>There's
 a monetary cost attached to each IMPRESSION, each CLICK, each 
CONVERSION. When you hear search marketers talk about CPC, that's 
&nbsp;the COST PER CLICK. Then then's CPL - COST PER LEAD. Then the RPC -
 REVENUE PER CONVERSION, RPClick - REVENUE PER CLICK &amp; so forth...<br>Basically, anything you do on a search engine has $$$ attached to it.<br><br>Now, the thing you searched for - the "red shoes" - we call that a term.<br>There's two kinds of terms - headterms and tailterms.<br>Headterms
 are terms that yield clicks and revenue every single day. Why ? Well, 
because someone somewhere on the planet wants to buy a red shoe, and the
 planet is big enough and red shoes are popular enough so that they get 
searched every day. So the "red shoe" term is associated with a 
&lt;NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS, NUMBER OF CLICKS, NUMBER OF CONVERSIONS&gt; 
daily vector, with nonzero terms. That means over time you can compute 
interesting things like median RPC, median CPC, and then build Bidding 
Models for them. This is what I do. This is my bread and butter. Mostly,
 it involves math like Lagrangians and Curve Fitting and Brent 
Optimization - see "<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170229/http://www.jasq.org/just-another-scala-quant/blue-collar-math">Blue Collar Math</a>" for details on what I do. Its like 99% math, 1% engineering ( or writing code ).<br><br>However,
 &nbsp;what if, instead of searching for "red shoes", you search for 
"moulinex food processor 8000" ? Now, how many people on the planet will
 want to buy this exact food processor on a given day ? Probably zero. 
So that's a tailterm. If you have a tailterm, your daily 
vector&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS, NUMBER OF CLICKS, NUMBER OF
 CONVERSIONS&gt; &nbsp;looks like &lt;0,0,0&gt;. &nbsp;But ofcourse, 
there will be days on which some fucker actually searches for this 
moulinex, and you end up with a nonzero vector.<br><br>Now, lets look at
 the scale of this problem in real life. Say you are a Macy's. You are 
going to have 5 MILLION terms in your portfolio - these are the things 
people search for, so you'd like a Macy's ad to show up when they search
 for them. Of these 5 MILLION, say some 80% are tailterms! That means, 
people very rarely search for them, so their daily vector looks like 
&lt;0,0,0&gt; , though there will be the odd day when somebody does 
search for them and you end up with a nonzero vector.<br><br>Say Macy's 
wants to spend $100,000 per day, on these 5 million terms. Since ther 
CPC, RPC etc. is well known for the 20% of the headterms, you can build a
 nice portfolio optimization model using Lagrange, and it'll work for 
those head terms. But what do you do about tail terms - 80% of 5 million
 is 4 million. So you don't have any kind of model for the 4 million 
tails, because they mostly look like &lt;0,0,0&gt; every day, except 
sometimes they don't. What do you do ?<br><br>Think of each tailterm as a
 bad hen. Instead of laying an egg a day like a good hen, these bad hens
 are very unpredictable. They lay maybe 3 eggs over 1 full year, and it 
is not known whether they will lay the egg tomorrow or not! Ofcourse, 
you have historical data on the egg-laying behavior for as long as you 
want. So for say 1 full year, you know what the daily vector looks like.
 So you've got 366 daily vectors per bad hen. And you've got 4 million 
bad hens. Can you put enough hens in a coop so you get an omlette every 
day ?<br><br>Some naive approaches ( these approaches actually work, but not all the time :)<br><br>1.
 Say a bad hen laid an egg on Day 5, Day 17, and Day 274. The rest of 
the days in the year, it did not lay an egg. Model this distribution as a
 frequency of 366/3. This is a horrible model, because you are basically
 asserting the hen will lay an egg every 122 days - which isn't true at 
all. But hey, you got to model it somehow. So lets begin by converting 
each hen's annual egg distribution into a simple number, which is the 
frequency i.e. how many days to lay 1 egg.<br><br>Now think back to 
those algebra problems in middle school - If Tom takes 5 days to paint 
the wall and Will takes 3 days, together how long will they take ? This 
is a simple variant of <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean">harmonic mean</a>
 - they will take 5*3/(5+3) = 15/8 days ie. 1.9 days. Now add maybe 
Oscar who takes 4 days into the mix. Then add Adam who takes 7 
days....soon, you can easily make a bunch of people who together take 
LESS THAN ONE DAY to paint the wall!<br><br>By the same reasoning, it is
 possible to group enough hens with different egg-laying frequency 
together so the coop gives you an omelette every day - Just stack enough
 hens so their combined harmonic frequency is below one. From a 
programming standpoint, this is ideal - because you can compute these 
harmonic frequencies recursively. So given 4 million hens with their 
frequencies, writing a function that spits out the optimal number of 
clusters and hens in each cluster - is not too hard. Should take you 
about an hour in Scala, tops.<br><br>2. If you think of a coin toss 
problem, where laying the egg means Heads and not laying maps to a tail,
 you've got a Binomial distribution ie. a B(n,p) where n = number of 
trails = 366, p = number of heads/366 . So now you ask the question, 
given a bunch of binomial variables, can we say something about the 
distribution of their sum ? Here's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606170229/https://statistics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/SOL%20ONR%20467.pdf" target="_blank">rather interesting approach</a> to the problem.<br><br>3.
 Finally, suppose you break up the training data into 365 clustering 
days + 7 tuning days. You use the 365 days data to build k random 
clusters, say k = 100. So you build 100 coops, into which you stuff 
pretty much equal number of hens. A more intelligent clustering approach
 will simply use the Harmonic mean variant in approach #1. So you build k
 clusters such that the harmonic frequency per cluster &lt; 1. Now, you 
look at Day 366. If each cluster does not yield a egg, move hens from 
one cluster to another until it does! Then look at Day 367 &amp; repeat!
 So do this for 7 days. At this point, you have fewer than k clusters, 
but these clusters actually yield an egg for every one of those 7 days. 
So you've basically overtrained them on 7 days of data, and now you hope
 you have some stable distribution that will yield an egg per coop on 
the 8th day. &nbsp;Feel free to increase 7 days to 30 days etc...the 
idea is basically to use a year's worth of data to construct 
frequencies, then build random clusters so each cluster has harmonic 
frequency less than 1, then decrease the number of clusters even further
 by moving hens from 1 cluster to another in order to guarantee an egg 
for every one of the 7 ( or 30 ) tuning days. Then you hope everything 
works out well on your test set ( mostly it does, sometimes it doesn't 
:)<br><br><br>Any suggestions appreciated. Tailterm modeling is an 
interesting problem with practical monetary value. You can't make an 
omelette without breaking an egg - in this case, the problem is 
definitely worth breaking a few eggs!</font><br></div>
