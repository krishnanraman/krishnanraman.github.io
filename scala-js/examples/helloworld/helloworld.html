  <h3>2 player adversarial knapsack on a radial graph</h3>
  <h4>Rules of the game</h4>
  <li>You are playing against the computer. You = Green, Computer = Orange.
  <li>You see 64 pouches. Each pouch has a price and a weight. So $2 /3 means the pouch costs $2 and weighs 3 lbs.
  <li>To begin, click on any pouch. From then on, you can only click on a pouch the previous pouch is connected to.
  <li>When BOTH you and the computer cross 100 lbs, whoever makes the most money per pound wins!
  <li>Getting Stuck: If all the pouches you are connected to have already been clicked, you are stuck.
  <li>If you or the computer gets stuck, whoever makes the most money per pound wins!

  <h4>Advice:</h4>
  <li>Beware of pouches with negative dollar amount!
  <li>If you start in thev innermost circle or the outermost, your chances of winning are remote.
  <li>It is hard to beat the computer. But keep trying!
  <li>Beating the computer by making the computer get stuck is a nice strategy :)

  <h4>Notes:</h4>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/krishnanraman/krishnanraman.github.io/blob/master/scala-js/examples/helloworld/Knapsack.scala">Source Code in Scala</a>
  <li>Do NOT zoom in !!! The game is set up for fixed 900x900 coordinate space, not relative coordinates.
  <li>This is my first scala.js program, inspired by <a href="http://shadaj.me/">Shadaj</a>
  <li>As of July 2013, you can't use any Java built-in libraries in Scala.js, so I rely on JS for random numbers, not scala.util.Random
  <li>Thanks to SÃ©bastien Doeraene for helping out with Scala.js
